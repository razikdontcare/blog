Hey, I'm Razik, a frontend engineer and a computer science student.
I build web apps, mostly with React and Next.js. Sometimes I tinker with backend stuff too, just to keep things interesting. I enjoy learning tools that help me work faster, cleaner, and smarter.

## What's this blog about?

This blog’s kinda like my digital brain dump. I write about stuff I’m learning, problems I run into, and random tips that might help someone else (or future me).
Expect posts about web dev, side projects, debugging journeys, and maybe a few rants when things break.
